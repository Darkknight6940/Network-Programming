Qianjun Chen & Alseny Sylla

Usage:
	Compile: make    (makefile is provided)
	Run: use ./dht.out 127.0.0.1 port number seed and k

Result:
	The program compiles and runs successfully on our machines. 
    
	We tested functions:
		CONNECT
		FIND_NODE
		FIND_DATA
		STORE
		QUIT
	There are many norner cases we have not considered yet but
    We tested many times by stores nodes in buckets. 

	We found SHA1 open source code on github, then modified to get 
		a nodeId from the seed. 


Time spend on the homework: 
	Over 25 hours.
